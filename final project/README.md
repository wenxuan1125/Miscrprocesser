# Rotating-Music-Box
Course Project of Microprocessor System Lab., in NYCU, 2020 Fall

It's a rotatable music box being able to play lot of pre-defined famous melodies, like Pachelbel's Canon, Totoro, Greensleeves, etc. Users can select the song to be played  through our own laptop keyboard. The music box was equipped with two speakers, so it could play different melodies at the same time and worked as the duets. It was developed based on STM32L476RG.
